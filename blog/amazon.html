<p>Earlier today, I got the urge to <a href="https://planetofthepaul.com/wikipedia-download-usb-flash/">download all
		of Wikipedia onto a flash drive</a>. I went to Amazon to find a suitably large drive, but, to my
	dissatisfaction, the top result was a scam.</p>
<p>A purported <a

		terabyte USB flash drive</a> was the top result, and for only $19.99! Not only was it top result, it was
	<em>sponsored by Amazon.</em> (I don't actually know what this means, but it adds some legitimacy to the item
	and implies that Amazon endorses it).
</p>
<p>Of course, this is a scam. These devices have hacked firmware that reports a higher storage volume than the
	device actually has, resulting in malfunctions or corrupted data once the actual storage limit is reached (the
	"actual" storage limit varies, but is usually around 8GB).</p>
<p>Wanting to know more, I continued searching. Interestingly, the scam products <em>don't</em> show up when I
	search "128gb flash drive" on my laptop, but are present for the same search on my phone. Searching for "1tb
	flash drive", however, returns many fraudulent products in either case (on my laptop the first 16 results were
	all fakes).</p>
<p>To me, this is sad, but not surprising. Amazon runs little to no risk selling the fraudulent products, but still
	makes money off of them. The companies selling these products through Amazon also have no risk, as they are
	typically selling from outside the US/Canada. It's a "win win" for both parties, but a large problem for the
	majority of consumers who don't know that 2 cents/GB of flash storage is unfathomably cheap.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I will no longer be buying tech products from Amazon. I've been skeptical of the platform for a
	while, but such prevalence of scams and fraudulent activity is an absolute deal breaker for me. Who's to say how
	deep this rabbit hole goes? I'm sure it goes beyond flash drives, and I don't want to be one of the victims who
	buys a hypothetical 1TB flash drive for $20.</p>
