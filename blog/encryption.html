<h6 id="or-banning-encryption-considered-harmful">Or, <em>Banning Encryption Considered Harmful?</em></h6>
<p>As of late, I've been hearing about several governments planning to ban encryption.
	This is particularly concerning to me, and in my opinion should be raising alarm
	bells. However, it seems nobody is talking about it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-encryption-and-why-should-i-care">What is Encryption, and Why Should I Care?</h2>
<p>Encryption, in a general sense, is a set of mathematical formulas that turn arbitrary
	data, known as plaintext, into seemingly random data, known as ciphertext. This process
	usually uses one or more <strong>secret keys</strong>, and is done in such a way that only individuals
	with the secret keys can decrypt the data (i.e. turn the random-looking ciphertext into
	the plaintext).</p>
<p>As an example, encrypting a message could look like this:</p>
<p>"Hello, Alice!" -&gt; "Stmj5uSqytjBeLbn"</p>
<p>If anyone were to know the secret key (which would be decided beforehand), they could
	turn the random data back into the original message:</p>
<p>"Stmj5uSqytjBeLbn" -&gt; "Hello, Alice!"</p>
<p>Encryption is used every day, to protect things like your bank account, credit cards,
	personal photos, and more. Whenever you're using the internet, if you're on a secure
	website (such as Google or your bank's website), all of the information sent between
	your computer and the website you're visiting will be encrypted. This stops anyone
	other than you or the website you're viewing from seeing the data that is being
	transmitted. This is known more specifically as <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="wait-encryption-sounds-like-a-good-thing">Wait, encryption sounds like a good thing?</h2>
<p>While encryption can be used to do good, it also helps the bad guys. Paedophiles, sex
	traffickers, arms dealers, or any other kind of criminal using the internet is almost
	certainly using encryption to cover their tracks (if they're not, then they'll be
	caught pretty quick). This is the reasoning many goverments are using to ban encryption.
	If there's no encryption, criminals can't hide their messages being transmitted over
	the internet. Different governments are proposing different kinds of bans on encryption,
	but the one thing they all want to ban is <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>. This is the kind
	of encryption I'll talk about in the rest of this blog post.</p>
<h2 id="why-encryption-cant-be-banned">Why Encryption Can't Be Banned</h2>
<p>While the base logic of "banning encryption makes criminals easier to catch" seems solid,
	I would like to point out why it will not work:</p>
<p><em>Criminals do not follow the law.</em> Making encryption illegal won't stop criminals from
	using it! They're already breaking the law, so what's one more in favour of not getting
	caught?</p>
<p>You may now be thinking to yourself, <em>"but if it's banned, that means nobody is allowed
		to use it! If they're using encryption, you know they're a criminal!"</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, this isn't how things work in practice. Remember before when I
	said encrypting something makes it look random? If a criminal transmits encrypted data
	over the internet, there's no way to tell if it's encrypted data, or just random data!
	A solution to this could be, for example, to make transmitting random data illegal -
	Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Barring any impracticalities of this (of which there are many), criminals could just invent
	a "new" encryption algorithm that, instead of transmitting random data, transmits random
	english words. Now, the data no longer "appears" random to any anti-encryption onlookers.
	This could result in the anti-encryption party improving their detection algorithms
	and the criminals improving their methods of hiding, resulting in the same problem as before.
	The cycle continues.</p>
<p>Banning encryption doesn't stop anyone from using it if they really want to.
	It is impossible to detect, making any ban useless for actually catching criminals.
	It also cannot be "taken away" - Because it is a mathematical formula, anybody with enough
	technical knowledge can simply write their own encryption software.</p>
<h2 id="why-trying-to-ban-encryption-would-be-bad">Why Trying to Ban Encryption Would Be Bad</h2>
<p>Now, while banning encryption won't stop criminals from using it (as said before, criminals
	seem to have no qualms with breaking the law), it <em>will</em> stop law-abiding individuals and
	corporations from using it.</p>
<p>This means that, while the connection to your bank's website <em>used to be</em> end-to-end
	encrypted, now it isn't. Your bank account info, passwords, credit card numbers, personal
	information, or anything else sent across the internet will be sent in the open for all
	to see.</p>
<p>This will effectively be open season for criminally-minded hackers. Anybody who has the
	right tools<sup>1</sup> could sit in at the local Starbucks, connect to the public Wi-Fi
	network, and farm credit card numbers, passwords, and personal data to their heart's content.</p>
<p>Any data you send anywhere will be at risk of being stolen.</p>
<p><small>1: An important point here is that these tools are not at all hard to obtain or use.
		They're also something that can't be banned, in a similar way encryption can't be banned.</small></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While banning encryption can sound like a good idea on the surface, it is not something that will
	pan out well for the common person. Worse, it won't actually help in catching criminals (which was
	the whole point!). A ban on encryption will only weaken the privacy of law-abiding citizens and
	increase the risk associated with doing any sort of online activity (remember, without encryption,
	anyone who's listening can steal your info!). Banning encryption is a lose-lose scenario.</p>
<p>If you live in a democratic nation that is trying to ban encryption (looking at you, Australia, Spain, and the
	United Kingdom), please reach out to your government
	representatives! A ban on encryption is an ill-advised blunder that will cause irreparable damage with
	no benefit. Do your part to keep the internet safe!</p>
